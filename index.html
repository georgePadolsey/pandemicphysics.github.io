The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge influence on many aspects of science and its research - with medical physics being no exception.
From the physical processes that hold the potential to aid mass testing, to a consideration of how droplet motion governs the design of masks, to our understanding of neurophysics in relation to post-COVID-19 syndrome (long COVID), to the modelling and statistics that regularly feature in news broadcasts, the medical physics community has been integral to combating the spread and effects of the pandemic.
