                Since the first UK cases of COVID-19 at the end of 2019,the  government  has  faced  a  constant  challenge-  adaptingto  difficult  internal  affairs  decisions,  tumultuous  interna-tional  politics  and  the  overarching  task  of  keeping  casesand deaths low. Many initial factors strongly influence howwell a country responds to the pandemic, but it is clear thatthe UK started in an excellent position- with strong borrow-ing  power,  strong  scientific  infrastructure  and  an  interna-tionally admired health service.  However, across all mea-sures, the UK excess death rate from COVID-19 has beenone of the worst worldwide [1].  Whilst this may be an is-sue more suited to discussion within the political arena, itis evident that the UK scientific community, alongside gov-ernment, has played an key role in the response. The Scien-tific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has guidedgovernment action and numerous universities have workedto give reliable disease spread models, to develop vaccinesand to further our understanding of mitigation techniquesfor COVID-19. Therefore, it would be unfair to characterisethe COVID-19 response as a wholly political one: rather, itis an eclectic response alongside numerous scientific areas,not least medical physics

            <p>A  number  of  areas  have  been  of  particular  interest  interms  of  academic  research  related  to  the  pandemic.   Asof 2021, vaccines are by far the most prominent but thereare many others.  For instance, the medical physics aspectof the scientific response is of particular interest.  Medicalphysics is simply the term used to describe physics that canbe used to treat, diagnose and gain understanding of issueswithin the field of medicine. Radiation treatment for cancerand  X-ray  imaging  are  particularly  well  known  examplesbut medical physics has also proven highly useful in com-bating COVID-19.  Here, certain areas of relevant medicalphysics are explained and the success of their implementa-tions analysed.
            </p><p>Our statistical models of the spread of COVID-19 haveguided governments in their approach to COVID-19 mea-sures and UK lockdown. An understanding of the now wellknown ’R number’ requires an appreciation of the exponen-tial function and the mathematics of disease spread.   Thegeneral public’s understanding of COVID-19 is strongly in-fluenced by government briefings, which make heavy use ofstatistical data.  Data presentation and scientific communi-cation are key tools for any government attempting to per-suade the public of the necessity of COVID-19 measures:If not presented accurately and consistently this, alongsidemisinformation, can shape trust between the public and thegovernment in dangerous ways.
            </p><p>Our  understanding  of  common  physical  processes  hasoverseen  successful  mass  testing  for  COVID-19.   LateralFlow  Tests  can  only  be  understood  with  a  knowledge  ofcapillary flow and surface tension, whilst other diagnosticmethods  use  far  more  sensitive  enzyme  reactions.   Onlywhen we know the details of how each test works can wedecide which is appropriate for this pandemic- mass testingis clearly required but how far can we sacrifice sensitivity?The future of disease testing, not only for COVID-19, is ofparticular interest- with CT scanning and use of neural net-works as particularly fast moving research topics.
            </p><p>A consideration of how droplet motion governs the de-sign of masks seems particularly relevant with the knowl-edge that COVID-19 predominantly spreads through the air[2].   Additionally,  with a multitude of masks available tothe public, me must also understand why different types ofmasks are more effective than others.   A surprising rangeof common physical concepts help explain droplet motion-from intuitive Newtonian mechanics, to electromagnetism,to statistical models of random motion common in thermo-dynamics. Why is it that mask wearing is a necessity for thesocially responsible, helping stop the spread of COVID-19?
            </p><p>Medical physics isn’t only constrained to prevention anddiagnosis:   post-COVID-19  syndrome,  or  ’long  COVID’,has  shown  us  that  everyone  in  society  can  be  vulnerableto  lengthy  and  serious  health  problems  [3].   Here,  physi-cal concepts aid our understanding of (CUT THIS IF NOMATERIAL)
            </p><p>Why should we seek to gain an understanding of thesespecific medical physics areas in relation to COVID-19?  Itseems  clear  that  the  public’s  response  to  the  pandemic  isby no means a simple affair.  Whilst keeping ourselves andothers  safe  through  social  distancing,  mask  wearing  andfollowing  government  rules  has  been  everyone’s  concernfor  an  extended  period  of  time,  it  is  paramount  that  thenecessity  of  these  reactions  to  the  pandemic  is  widelyunderstood and believed in. Medical physics can give us aninsight into how and why certain measures are successfulin  stemming  the  spread  of  COVID-19.Furthermore,the  potential  medical  physics  holds  in  saving  lives  andreducing the socioeconomic fallout of the pandemic makesan appreciation of the underlying physical concepts of thefight against COVID-19 highly rewarding
